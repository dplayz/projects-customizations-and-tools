Heavily customized by dp
    - to add support for:
        - Spotify progress bar
        - Elapsed counter (somehow not perfect)
        - Activities Realtime reloading (keeping data until presence update)
    - to fix:
        - non-working status message and emoji
        - layout for small devices
    - to add to my website shortcode
What to expect next?
    - time left counter
    - upstreaming...? (idk, project seems untouched for 3+ months)
        (i'm an introvert, so don't expect much)
If you want it to be upstreamed, and experience my struggle, go ahead.
This customization work + fix went around 5 hours + 7 hours = 12 hours
