### dplayz/projects-customizations-and-tools
A mini repo made to expose the tools or project customizations I do to make my workflow easy.

---

# Catalog
Customizations
- discordstatus-website

Tools
- none yet (will move everything soon)

# Why not upstream the project customizations?
There are factors why:
1. I'm afraid to do so.
2. Customizations are too bad for upstream.
3. A better fix is coming to happen.
4. Project seems to be abandoned, and don't want to commit to the project

# Why single repo and folder for tools?
These tools does not deserve to have a separate repo.
- Not worth for full effort
- Not ready for public contributions
- These are just enhancements to my workflow
